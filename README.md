## 📌 Project Overview

ReeVue maps real interview and workplace experiences to help job seekers make smarter decisions. Think of it like **Google Reviews — but for companies and job interviews**.

Users can search for a company, read what others said about their interview process (difficulty, rounds, HR attitude), and learn what it's really like working there (culture, salary, management). They can also leave their own reviews anonymously.

## 🎯 Project Scope

- Build a full-stack review platform with anonymous posting
- Implement company profiles with aggregated ratings and interview data
- Enable search and filtering by industry, city, rating, and difficulty
- Allow users to share actual interview questions by role
- Support salary data shared anonymously by users
- Provide email notifications for watched companies
- Moderate content using AI to flag spam or hate speech

### 🔍 Search & Discovery
Users can search and filter companies by name, industry, city, size, rating, and difficulty, with trending and recently reviewed sections.

### ⭐ Review System
Reviews cover Interview Difficulty, HR Communication, Offer Transparency, Work-Life Balance, and Culture — all posted anonymously. Users can upvote, downvote, or flag reviews, and an AI moderator filters spam and hate speech.

### 🏢 Company Profiles
Company profiles are auto-populated with logo, size, location, average ratings, interview timelines, and anonymous salary ranges.

### 👤 User Accounts
Accounts let users track their submitted reviews and save companies to a watchlist.

### 💬 Community & Trust
Under each review, there are comment threads for discussion, with rate-limited posting to keep things fair.

### 📋 Interview Q&A
Users can share and answer real interview questions per role and department.

### 🔔 Notifications & Alerts
Get email alerts when a watched company gets new reviews or starts actively hiring.
